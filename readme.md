## Object recognition based alarm app for Android
_by Timur Valiev, Ilgizar Murzakov, Vasily Alabugin and Nikita Vilunov_

### Build 
Since it is not possible yet to import OpenCV into a project using gradle,
you need to download OpenCV SDK for Android from 
[this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/4.1.2/opencv-4.1.2-android-sdk.zip/download)
and put into the parent folder of this project in order to build the app.
